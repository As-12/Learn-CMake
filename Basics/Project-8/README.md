# Project-8 : Using CMake for GoogleTest

This project contains a header library and a static library. Then use CMake to build and run unit test from those library.

This project download GoogleTest from repository and build the source.
I think it may be better to use GitHub link repository and just add_subdirectory(x, y) from CMake.
